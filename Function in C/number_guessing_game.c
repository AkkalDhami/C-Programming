     * The function prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and N. It continues to prompt the user until they guess the correct number or reach 10 attempts.//+
     * If the user guesses the correct number, it congratulates them and displays the number of attempts it took.//+
     * If the user does not guess the correct number within 10 attempts, it informs them that they lost and displays the correct number.//+
